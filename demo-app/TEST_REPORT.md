## Performance Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Laravel 11 | Laravel 12 | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Routes Processed | **46** | **46** | Identical route count for fair comparison |
| Generation Time | 0.09s | 0.12s | Similar performance with slight variation |
| Cache Size | 14.11 KB | 20.96 KB | Laravel 12 larger due to enum/FormRequest complexity |
| Cache Files | 1 | 8 | Laravel 12 has more complex resources |

## Code Changes Made

### File: `src/Support/ValidationRules.php`

#### Method: `extractRuleName()`
```php
// Before: Only handled string rules
public static function extractRuleName(string $rule): string

// After: Handles string, array, and object rules for enum support
public static function extractRuleName(string|array|object $rule): string
```

#### Method: `inferFieldType()`
```php
// Added enum handling to properly detect enum field types
if ($ruleName === 'enum') {
    return 'string';  // Enums are typically strings
}
```

### File: `composer.json`
```json
// Updated PHP requirement
"php": "^8.2"  // Previously ^8.1
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Route Types Tested

- ✅ POST endpoints (store, create, upload)
- ✅ PUT/PATCH endpoints (update)
- ✅ DELETE endpoints (destroy)
- ✅ Protected routes (auth:sanctum middleware)
